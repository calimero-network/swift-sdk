// Trusting a TEE node's image by its signed release, fetched at run time from
// anywhere, instead of shipping the release's `published-mrtds.json` with the
// app. Port of mero-js `src/sealed/release.ts`.
//
// Each mero-tee node release publishes `published-mrtds.json` (the
// measurements of its image) with a cosign keyless bundle, signed by the
// mero-tee release workflow on GitHub Actions. `verifySignedNodeRelease`
// checks that signature here, against the Sigstore trust root embedded in this
// SDK, so the file can come from any source: the cloud's mirror
// (`GET https://cloud.calimero.network/api/tee/node-releases/{version}`), a
// mirror of your own, or a file bundled with the app. None of them is
// trusted; a file whose signature does not verify is refused.
//
// What is trusted: the signer (``TeeTrust/nodeReleaseSigner``, the identity
// core pins as `NODE_RELEASE_IDENTITY`), the Sigstore public-good trust root,
// and the minimum release you pass. What is not: the transport, the server
// that serves the release, and the relay's choice of release. A relay can
// present any genuinely signed release at or above the minimum, and no
// other; its quote must then match that release's measurements exactly, so it
// cannot claim one release and run another.
