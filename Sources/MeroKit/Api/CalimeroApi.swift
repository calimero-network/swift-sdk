// and reads each answer; what it cannot know is written here:
//
// - ``SealedClientTransport`` carries every request to the node the
//   ``CalimeroClient`` uses now, sealed to its attested key, with the
//   client's credential and its `401` refresh and `421` node moves.
// - ``StepUpMiddleware`` answers a `412 CONFIRM_REQUIRED` with a passkey
//   assertion and a `428 OPERATOR_SIGNATURE_REQUIRED` with the operator
//   key's signature, sending the request once more.
// - ``CalimeroClient/perform(passkey:operatorSigner:_:)`` runs one request
//   for the facade (Generated/Facade.swift) and throws MeroKit's errors.
